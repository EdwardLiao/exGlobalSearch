Forked from exvim/exGlobalSearch, removed dependency on global variables used by exvim.
Usage:

* In your project directory, type `mkid` to generate the ID database.
* Launch vim in this directory, type `:GS <symbol_name>` to find the symbol, for example:
:GS fileName
Will list all the 'fileName's in a new window.
